/**
 * Gemini Layout Service
 *
 * Core intelligence engine for the "Ultimate Layout Builder".
 * Uses Gemini 3 Flash for high-speed multimodal analysis of:
 * - Images (Layout Detection)
 * - Videos (Motion & Flow Extraction)
 * - Hybrid Inputs (Layout + Style mixing)
 *
 * Capabilities:
 * - "Vision Loop": Critiques generated layouts against originals
 * - "Motion Extraction": Analyzes video keyframes for animation configs
 * - "Zero-Preset": Detects arbitrary values (px, hex) for exact replication
 *
 * This file now serves as a barrel export for backward compatibility.
 * All implementation has been split into smaller modules in ./geminiLayout/
